<h1> ABOUT ME</h1>

<h2> a little bit about me</h2>

<div class="content">
    <p class="firstp">Everything you see on this page was created by myself even dwn ot the webpage itself! I am still learning webdesign so bear with me. I started designing in 2006 and have always found fun and enjoyable. I have a natural creative mindset so once i am able to put this to use in a 3d environment i feel i am in the right place. <br><br> The programs i am accustomed to would be Maya. Maya is the state-of-the-art, industry standard application that is widely used for 3D modeling, animation, and effects. Users of the program produce content for film and television production, video game development, architectural design, and web and print production.

    Question: What's the Difference Between AutoCAD and Other 3D programs?
    You often see AutoCAD and other CAD programs spoken of as if they're a different animal from 3D modeling and animation programs such as 3D Studio Max, Maya, Blender, and the innumerable others out there. But when you open it up and take a look at it, it seems like it's designed for 3D modeling and, to some extent, animation. So what's the difference?
    Answer: The primary difference is the purpose it's designed for. Your usual 3D modeling and animation programs are designed to be a blank canvas where you can build anything from scratch. CAD programs such as AutoCAD are designed to be technical tools with functions in industrial design, mechanical design, architecture, and even areas such as aerospace engineering and astronautics. The term CAD itself stands for either computer-aided design or computer-aided drafting, focused on more technical design and drafting uses.<br><br> So in the end, when you take the long view, there really isn't much difference between CAD programs and other 3D modeling and animation programs. When you get up close and personal, though, the devil's in the details, and it's all about functionality and design. A Ferrari and a Honda are both cars, but one's designed for speed, the other for reliable transport. It's the same sort of difference between CAD programs and 3D animation software.</p>

    <p class="firstp">First and foremost I am a underground grime music producer from Manchester, I also do 3d design and As a 3D Visualizer or computer-aided design (CAD) technician, you're the intermediate between architects or property developers who envision the designs and construction professionals who make the designs a reality. You are responsible for turning their sketches into computerized blueprints or 3D visuals. In addition, you make needed changes to the plans and perform administrative tasks like storing and modifying blueprints or making adaptations to 3D models which you have created and this is the field of 3d design which i wish to work in. <br><br> I make Grime on a computer music program called Reason and I have recently began to learn how to use fruity loops. I have built a home set up over the years which allows me to make beats whenever i am in the creative spirit. This is something i have done since my early teens. Now as adult i still like to make musioc as i find certain beats i come across inspiring. This inspiration propels me to get in the home studio and make something myself.</p>

    <p class="firstp">I also like to go to the gym and have trained for quite a number of years. I have started working in the industry and now upload free workouts on my social media platforms. Fitness is something that takes a certain level of seld discipline and great work ethic. If you have neither of these you dont yet have the mindset to become consistent if excersise is one of your goals. <br><br> I began watching what i eat a few years ago and now i am more conscious about what my body consumes. You are what you eat is true if you do it long enough. I now have much healthier diet than i did a few years ago but i still have a sweet and sugar addistion. So although i dont eat crisps or chocolates i do like apple pie cake and custard! i beleive a certain amount of fat is importatnt in maintaining a balanced diet whilst training. As long as you monitor what you class as fat and how much you consume it. <br><br> These are the three main things about me that i intend to continue doing and hopefully  become self employed in the process on of these if not all of them! Take a stroll on my websites other pages to see what things i get upto</p>
