    <p class="firstp">Hi. I see you are now on my "extra stuff" page!. This section will continue to grow as i become familiar with web development. For now i will discuss some of the extra things i am into. <br><br> I play on Playstation nowadays i have come away from xbox and the games i tend to play are Grand Theft Auto 5, Tekken 7, StreetFighter 5, Call of duty Cold War jsut to name a few. I have group on facebook for people that play the game Tekken 7. It currently has over 30 Thousand members from different arears all over the world and rising. It has pretty much blown up since i created the group  back in in the beginning of 2019. People who join this private community get to make new friends, meet new fighters and upload videos of fights or any online matches they have participated in. If you like Tekken you can find us all there... <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/139872326635108/?ref=share"target="_blank">Click here</a> if you are on facebook and want to find the group where we all discuss and play Tekken!!</a> <img src="TEKKEN-7.jpg"alt="tekken7picture" width="600" height="150"> </p>

    <p class="firstp">Something else i am interested in us the UFC or any forms of martial arts combat. I like to watch any of the big UFC fights that are comin up and i have always watched krate and kung fu films as a child. This is what i think got me into fitness <br><br> I am a fan of comic book ar and i have decorated my apartment with cool scenes from street fighter. The vibrant colours and skillfull artwork is something i admire and generally putsme in a positive mood. Hence my studio is surrounded with this art on every wall.</p>

    <p class="firstp">Another hobby of mine is web design. I started coding a long time ago and built my firstwebsite though a website builder like moonfruit. The i realised i hadnt actually designed the website myself and it was done through another company . So i decided to find a way of learning which i did through a course i picked up whilst in uni. I have now forgotten that web design knowledge so i am here starting again from scratch. <br><br> As you are already here i wont post the link to my website haha. But on a serious note web design is something i most definatley interested in and hope to excell in over the next few years. I think coding and web development will give the person if they are technically minded to be able to be more flexible when it comes to work patters and working hours and this what i truly believe will help me to become much more self sufficient in the future.</p>
