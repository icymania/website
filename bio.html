                    Hi . Now we are at the Biography section. I began working in my teaens in sales and got one of my first jobs where i actually won an Award back in 2002 in door to door sales. I didnt sign up for any door to door sales job i just remember responded to an advert in the paper for sales and i think i didnt read the word field sales or i didnt now what it was at the time. Either way i ended up doing really well and got an award for best salesperson. However that was a pyramid scheme job so i chose a different field of work. Design.

                    After doing the door to door sales job i moved into more non customer facing sales roles which were predominantly done by phone. I worked in a few call centers and ended up in the financial services industry. After a few years of working through debt managemnet IVA'S bankruptcies i then worked in collections for a global transaction processing firm. Then i worked for a law frm which was my most recent job before i decided to try the self employed route.I beleive you should chase your dreams and i believe design is where i should be.
